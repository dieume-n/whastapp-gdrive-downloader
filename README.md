WHAPA
====
whapa.py is an android whatsapp database parser which automates the process and presents the data handled by the Sqlite database in a way that is comprehensible to the analyst.
If you copy the "wa.db" database into the same directory as the script, the phone number will be displayed along with the name.

Please note that this project is an early stage. As such, you could find errors. Use it at your own risk!

Reports
=====
To create reports the first thing we need to do is to configure the file"./cfg/settings.cfg". For example:

	[report]
	logo =./cfg/logo.png
	company = Foo S.L
	record = 1337
	unit = Research group
	examiner = B16f00t
	notes = Chat maintained between the murderer and the victim
	
Here we must put our company logo, company or unit name, as well as the assigned registration number, unit or group where we belong, who is the examiner and we can also specify notes on the report.

To generate the report we must specify the option "English" whether we want the report in English, as well as "ES" whether we want the report in Spanish.

If you copy the "wa.db" database into the same directory as the script, the phone number will be displayed along with the name.
For the report to contains the images, videos, documents... you must copy the "WhatsApp/Media" folder of your phone to the whapa directory, otherwise the program will generate thumbnails.

If we want to print the document or create the report in pdf, It recommends in the print option -> scale the view <= 60% or 70%, otherwise the report will be displayed too large.


WHAMERGE
====
whamerge is a tool to joins backups in a new database, to be able to be analyzed and obtain more information, such as deleted groups, messages, etc...
